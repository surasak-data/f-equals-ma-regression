Predicting Force using Linear Regression (F = ma)
This project demonstrates how to apply simple linear regression to model the relationship between mass, acceleration, and force based on the physics equation F = ma.

Tools Used
Python
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Project Steps
Simulate data using the equation F = ma
Explore data and visualize relationships
Build a linear regression model to predict force
Evaluate model performance
Result
The model accurately learns the linear relationship between mass and acceleration to predict force, with RÂ² score close to 1.0.
